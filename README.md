In this project, photos were selected such the application of a specific algorithm could have practical effects. 
For example, a photo(Fores&Clouds.jpg) with areas that should be white was chosen for White Patch algorithm, 
a photo dominated by gray tones(shipInFog.jpeg) was chosen for Gray World algorithm, 
and finally, a dark colored image(twig-on-cloth-and-plate.jpg) was chosen for Scale By Max algorithm The lightening photo would allow details to be examined.
